To Start Game:
Since we created a playable Unity file by exporting our game through the editing menu you simply have to click on the playable file to begin the game. Once the game starts you will be shown the main menu with three options to select. The menu should look roughly as follows:
Easy
Medium 
Hard
		Start		quit
Once the player has selected a difficulty the player must select “Start” whereupon the game begins. There are five levels the player must progress through to beat the game. 

Keybindings:
We have implemented all of the requirements given within the HW1 canvas assignment, thusly the controls are as follows:
W: Moves the ball forward
A: Moves the ball to the left
D: Moves the ball to the right
S: Moves the ball backward
0: Stops the ball
Space: Makes the ball jump
Mouse: Controls the camera

Pickups:
There are two pickups in the game:
Explosives that damage the player and launch them in an outward direction 
Statues that give the player a single point
